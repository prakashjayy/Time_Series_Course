# Predicting monthly sales of champagne by Makridakis and Wheelwright, 1989 using Time Series Forecasting
Welcome to the Time-Series Project!
In this project, you will demonstrate what you have learned in this course by Predicting the monthly sales of champagne

We have seen in the in-class session how Time Series Forecasting Problem needs to be approached. We learnt about:

* Time Series Analysis and Time Series Forecasting
* Different Kinds of Forecasting
* Visualizing Time-Series Data
* Decomposing Time-Series Data into Trend, Seasonality and residuals
* Time-Series validation and Cross-Validation Strategies
* Measuring Forecasting Errors
* Simple Moving Averages
* Exponential Moving Averages
* Holt's Linear method
* Holt's Winter Method
* AR, MA , ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA models


### Load the required libraries

You can use pandas, datetime, math, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn and statsmodels for this exercise


## Dataset

For this exercise, we will use the sales data of Makridakis and Wheelwright company.
- The dataset provides the number of monthly sales of champagne from January 1964 to September 1972, or just under 10 years of data.
- The values are a count of millions of sales and there are 105 observations.
- The dataset is credited to Makridakis and Wheelwright, 1989.
